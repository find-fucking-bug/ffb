## Features

- Automatically analyzes the last terminal output.
- Provides clear explanations of errors.
- Suggests solutions with code examples.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Installation

You can install **FFB** via pip:

```bash
pip install ffb
```
## Usage

To use FFB, simply run your Python script as usual. If an error occurs, call ffb to analyze the last output.

## Example
Given the following Python code:

```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    result = a / b
    print(f"Result: {result}")

divide_numbers(10, 0)
```

Running this code will produce the following error:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/aliymnx/Desktop/main.py", line 6, in <module>
    divide_numbers(10, 0)
  File "/Users/aliymnx/Desktop/main.py", line 2, in divide_numbers
    result = a / b
             ~~^~~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

To analyze this error using FFB, simply run:

```bash
ffb
```

FFB will analyze the error and provide a detailed solution:

```python
Error Summary The error occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero, which is undefined.

Solution

def divide_numbers(a, b):
   if b == 0:
      return "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
  else:
    result = a / b
    return result

print(divide_numbers(10, 0))


Explanation To resolve this issue, we've added a simple check in the divide_numbers function to ensure that the divisor (b) is not zero. If it is zero, the function returns an error message instead of attempting the division, thus preventing the ZeroDivisionError.
```
